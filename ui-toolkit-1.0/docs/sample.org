* Introduction to UI Toolkit
The UI Toolkit consists of the UI 1.0 template and the helper scripts that 
extracts the content of labs hosted with Amrita UI format to UI 1.0.
** Why is this needed?
For two reasons: One is uniformity i.e uniform user interface for authoring
and interacting with the virtual labs. Also, effective use of these labs
depends on simple and uniform web interfaces and a homogeneous hosting framework.
Secondly, if better versions of the template are created in the future, the lab
content can be automatically transferred.
 
** When should we use it?
Once your sources are ready with the content i.e (theory, procedures, experiments
(simulations), quiz, images, videos etc). 

Before we move on to the procedure, it is essential to understand the structure
of UI template 1.0.

* The UI Template structure
** [[file:]]html-lab-page-design.png
This is the general structure of the template

** [[file:html-id-specific-lab-page-design.png]]
This is how the html page of the lab should look like with respect to id.

** [[file:html-id-specific-experiment-page-design.png]]
This is how the html page of the experiment should look like with respect to id.

* How to use the template?
Case 1: Newly built labs
Mention the lab name under header and place the tabs content under
article followed by sections and order the articles accordingly.
Also, list out the experiments in content.html.

This is the procedure that needs to be followed for any newly
built lab.

Case 2: Labs hosted with Amrita Format(Collaborator Framework)
For converting the labs that are using Amrita format, we have scripts in the UI
toolkit that automatically extracts and converts them to UI 1.0.

** Why to use these scripts?
Manual approaches to restructure the lab contents are error-prone and inefficient. 
So it becomes imperative to develop an automated algorithm to efficiently restructure
the lab contents from different lab formats to a common UI.

A lot of manual effort is required to map the UI content from a given lab to the
new UI format of the Virtual-lab. We thus provide a scheme called "CHANGER" to automate
this process. For a given lab, it enables agility and convenience from getting the
contents and transferring them to the UI format (or the Blue-icon theme) of the Virtual-labs.

**  Understanding Amrita Format
The input is the Collaborator framework which doesn't provide a uniform and comprehensive
tool for complete development. It lacks published document structure which hinders
the portability of labs.

An examined structure of the Collaborator framework is given below:

** Procedure for using scripts
Let us start with an example, say for the lab chosen at a random is given 
by the following url:
(http://iitkgp.vlab.co.in/?sub=39&brch=124&brch=124&sim&sim=922&cnt=1)

Here the breakup of the url is as per the following scheme,
firstly the labs are classified under subjects or domains 
indicated by "sub" and then each branch or lab under those 
domains is indicated by a seperte "branch" number. After that each 
experiment in the lab is indicated by a simulator number named in the
url as "sim". Lastly the count or "cnt" number indicates the breakup 
of pages under each experiment, namely theory, introduction etc.

As per the given url in the example we have sub=39, as the "Electrical Engineering"
domain and brch=124, as the "analog signals, network and measurement laboratory",
finally the sim=922, refers to the experiment named "Verification of Superposition 
Theorem" and cnt=1, indicated the "Theory" page under it. 

*** organize.sh

**** Definition

Shell script to get the contents from the lab url and store them in an 
organized format as university ! subject ! branch ! labs ! experiments.

**** Method
Here the structure of the lab is analyzed and accordingly the script breaks 
up the url and creates folders recursively in an organized format as per
that in the above denition.

*** transfer.py

**** Definition
Python based script to transfer the contents under one lab­experiment in an 
automated way to the requisite UI format say the new Blue­icon theme format.

**** Method

A Python library called "Beautiful Soup", designed to parse lxml, html5 files 
and tree traversals has been here used to parse the contents of each 
lab­experiment's html files. These parsed contents are mapped to the Blue­icon 
theme format and copied into the "content.html" by use of python commands.

* link_changer.sh
** Definition
Shell script to link the images downloaded in the user files folder to contents.html of the
lab-experiments mapped using the former scheme.
** Method
Here the script replaces the path of the images inside each content.html file for all
experiments in the lab with the appropriate and desired path of the new directory after
the mapping is over.
