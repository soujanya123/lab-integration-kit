<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Current</span> <span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Approaches in Ceramic Archaeology, Pottery Analysis:</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">Ceramic artifacts,  made from fired clay, and stone tools are the most durable objects  created by prehistoric peoples. While archaeologically durable, ceramics  have another attribute that makes them invaluable to  archaeologists—they break or wear out during use, thus entering the  archaeological record fairly soon after manufacture. These two important  characteristics of ceramics have garnered them a long and enduring role  as primary data in archaeological inquiry. The archaeologist surrounded  in the laboratory by thousands of pot sherds sorted into meaningful  piles on long lab tables is an image that is bound to be with the  discipline for as long as it is practiced.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">The art of  manufacturing pottery was discovered about 12,000 years ago in the Old  World and about 5,000 years ago in the New World. Pottery manufacture  generally accompanied the transition to food production and increasing  sedentism in the prehistory of most parts of the world. Pottery has been  of enormous benefit to humanity in the form of the most common everyday  objects—water carriers, food storage vessels, cooking vessels, and  serving vessels. Precisely because of the intimate relationship among  everyday activities such as food storage, preparation, and consumption,  pottery has long been one of the primary types of artifacts collected by  archaeologists. Ceramics are not limited to utilitarian wares, however,  and include fine wares for ceremonial functions and trade as well as  other types of objects such as figurines, jewelry, and even toys. One of  the enduring benefits of clay as a raw material is its plasticity,  allowing the artisan to shape and form it to myriad functional and  imaginative requirements. In addition to formal and functional  characteristics derived from the plasticity of the raw material, pottery  often conveys additional information about its makers and users in the  form of painted designs and illustrations. From simple geometric  patterns to the elaborate illustrative decorations of Maya or Chinese  ceramics, artisans added important stylistic and even political and  mythological information to their pottery for millennia. To this day,  few people fail to be stirred by the wonderful painted decorations of  Classical Grecian urns or the marvelous zoomorphic creatures on Mimbres  pots. From their first invention and on through the ages, ceramic  objects served crucial functional, aesthetic, and informational purposes  for peoples all around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">All of the attributes  of ceramic artifacts shape, size, type of clay, type of temper, surface  treatment, and painting, to name a few serve as a rich and varied set  of data for archaeologists intent on reconstructing past human life  ways. There are essentially four types of analyses that archaeologists  perform on ceramic artifacts in order to obtain the data contained  within them: experimental studies, form and function analysis, stylistic  analysis, and technological analysis.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">Experimental studies  consist of controlled experiments used to replicate prehistoric ceramic  manufacturing processes. From these studies, archaeologists gain  valuable information on firing techniques, firing temperatures, and the  properties of various tempers, glazes, and paints. In addition to  replicative experimentation, archaeologists have also taken advantage of  ethnographic observations of traditional pottery manufacturing from  societies around the world to better understand the manufacture, use,  and reuse of pottery in traditional cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">The analysis and  interpretation of ‘Pottery’ (ceramics) materials allows archaeologists  to accomplish a variety of tasks: establish times scales, Document  interconnections between different areas, and propose activities,  interactions, and identities in the past.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Why is pottery important to historians?</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">The shapes of vessel  and the modes of decoration change through time, and so pottery can be  used to understand the periods during which a site was occupied. In  addition, pottery was traded (either for itself or because it was used  as a container for other products such as wine or oil), and so the  presence of imported objects on a site can tell us about the way in  which the inhabitants of the site were involved in trade with other  regions.</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Why do we collect and study pottery?</span></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="content">Pottery is often the  most abundant type of artifact within an archaeological assemblage  because it was easily broken, does not decay and could not be recycled.&nbsp;  During most time periods pottery was reasonably cheap to replace and  almost everyone used it.&nbsp; In this respect, it is very useful for  archaeologists because it presents us with a significant sample of  material that provides information about how people from all levels of  society lived in the past.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">How do we analyze pottery?</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">The analysis of  prehistoric ceramics allows archaeologists to construct cultural  sequences, reconstruct daily life, investigate patterns of long-distance  exchange, and examine questions of social inequality.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Identification of&nbsp;vessel form, function, and design</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Identification of&nbsp;manufacturing techniques</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Typology and seriation</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Quantitative recording of metric attributes</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Comparisons with&nbsp;regional ceramic sequences&nbsp;to place the assemblage into chronological and cultural context</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="content">Using this method of  classification helps us to identify different types of pottery. Pottery  recovered from an excavation is almost always broken with whole pots  rarely discovered.&nbsp; This is because most of the time we are dealing with  rubbish left behind by people at some point in time.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">What sort of information can we obtain?</span></h3>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="content">Once we have created a  dataset, analysis of a pottery assemblage can give an insight into  three main areas. In order to create a dataset that we can use to look  for patterns based on the classified pot types, the broken sherds  (pieces of pot) need to be quantified.&nbsp; The three methods commonly used  to achieve this are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Sherd count (recording the number of pieces identified as the same)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Weight of sherds (recording the total weight of pieces identified as the same)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p class="content">Estimated Vessel  Equivalents (measuring the percentage of surviving pot rim from  individual vessels). At least two methods are always used together to  try and make the quantification as accurate as possible.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Dating and Chronology:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>  </strong></p>
<p class="content">The abundance of  pottery and its multiplicity of form, fabric and decoration, as much as  the vast literature on the material, conspire to make pottery, in many  ways, the ideal medium for carrying chronological information. Dating  evidence acquired at one site or context, perhaps an association between  a pottery type and a historically – dated event such as a destruction  horizon, may be attached to the pot, or an element such as its forms,  decoration or fabrics. Its appearance may be subsequently being employed  to date other contexts, where other pottery types may be dated by  secondary association.</p>
<p class="content">It may be recognized  that particular forms vary in a consists and predictable fashion,  perhaps allowing a particular vessel to be placed at a point in a  developmental (and hence potential chronological) sequence.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Trade and Exchange:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">A fabric series  provides examples of pots made in different places and by comparing  fabrics we can work out where a vessel has come from.&nbsp; This gives us  information about trade both in terms of where pots are being made but  also what products they may have contained.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentEquation"><img alt="" src="http://125.20.82.167/Anthro/pott/images/gg.jpg"></p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Social Status and Function:</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">Some types of pot  were used for particular things, for example cooking, storage, eating  and drinking.&nbsp; Comparing the amounts of different functional types can  give an insight into how a site or part of a site was being used.&nbsp; Some  imported pottery was more expensive to buy than local wares, so working  out the quantities of more expensive items can indicate relative  wealth.&nbsp; It is also important to combine information gained from pottery  with other things such as animal bone and environmental evidence, to  look at issues such as cuisine and trading of goods.</p>
<p class="content">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Conclusion: </span></strong></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">The Future of Pottery studies</span></strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="content">We have, on the other  hand, an ever increasing range of tools at our disposal with which to  examine our material. These are applicable not only at the level of the  individual sherd or fabric, but also to the relationship between  assemblages. These patterns are not only `internal` between different  types of ceramics: but also with other classes of artifacts. More than  ever before, pottery studies must argue actively for a place at the  ‘high table’ of archaeology.</p>
<p class="content">The combination of  abundance, near indestructibility and almost unique plasticity of the  medium conspire to make the ceramic assemblage one of the most resources  from archaeological site.</p>
